Codes to reproduce analyses and results in [Transcriptional targets of senataxin and E2 promoter binding factors are associated with neuro-degenerative pathways during increased autophagic flux]().

# Analysis workflow & relevant files.

- Bash code for **pre-processing of raw RNA-seq reads** can be found in the *code* folder
- Code for the following steps could be found in the *analysis* folder and output of the analyses can be viewed as .html files located in the *docs* folder:
 1. **Quality checks (QC)** performed on raw, trimmed and aligned reads for three cell lines 
 2. **DE analyses for each cell line and summary of the results**
 3. **Over-representation testing of Transcription Factor Target(TFT) gene-sets**
 4. **Enrichment and perturbation testing of KEGG pathways**
 5. **Inference of TF-KEGG regulation**
